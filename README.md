### Hey 👋

Hi, I’m Clovis ! I’m a French Software engineer who is passionate about doing **open source** development and **building things** !

⚡ I am a trained Electronics & Embedded Systems engineer, but now I work with web technologies.

I like to build my own things at home too !

I’m currently working on an open-sourced CANOpen stack.
